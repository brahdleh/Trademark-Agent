# IP Agent
For the Oxford Eth 2025 hackathon we have created a Python bot that can help legal firms find infringement in trademark requests.

This Github houses the code ready to be deployed to the cloud as an API, but this is not currently running.

Please view the code in this Google Colab notebook, which contains 3 demos at the bottom of how the agent handles different requests.
