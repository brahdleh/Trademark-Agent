# IP Agent
For the Oxford Eth 2025 hackathon we have created a Python bot that can help legal firms find infringement in trademark requests.

This Github houses the code ready to be deployed to the cloud as an API, but this is not currently running.

Please view the code in this Google Colab notebook, which contains the 3 demos at the bottom of how the agent handles different requests.

**Class 37:** Covers building construction, repair, and installation services, including those related to computer hardware.

**Exact Matches:**
APPLE
APPLE
APPLE

**Recommended Actions:**

Given the presence of identical trademark registrations, the following actions are recommended to mitigate the risk of infringement:

**Modify Application:** The client should consider modifying the proposed trademark to distinguish it from the existing registrations. This could involve adding a distinctive element (word, logo, or design) to the trademark "APPLE". This should be a discussion with the client.

**Consult Legal Advice:** Engaging with an experienced EU IP lawyer is crucial. A legal professional can conduct a more in-depth analysis of the existing trademark landscape, assess the specific risks of infringement in each relevant class, and advise on the most appropriate course of action.

**Negotiate with Holder:** Depending on the scope of the existing trademark registrations and the client's specific business activities, it may be possible to negotiate a co-existence agreement or other form of arrangement with the trademark holders. This could allow the client to use the "APPLE" trademark in a limited manner or within a specific geographic area. This action may prove fruitless due to the volume of matches but could be attempted once consultation has taken place.

It is important to act quickly to determine the best course of action and minimse potential costs or delays from third-party issues.

**Date:** February 9th, 2025

**Company Name:** Bradcorp

**Classification Details:**

The relevant class identified for this audit is:

**Class 13:** Encompasses goods such as firearms, ammunition, projectiles, explosives, and fireworks.

To establish and secure exclusive rights to the "Bradcorp" trademark within the European Union for goods in Class 13, the following actions are recommended:

File a European Union Trademark (EUTM) application: A formal application should be filed with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) seeking registration of the "Bradcorp" mark for the specific goods within Class 13 that the client intends to use the mark in connection with.
Monitor the Trademark Register: Continuously monitor the EUIPO trademark register for any newly filed applications that may be similar to "Bradcorp" to proactively address any potential future conflicts.
